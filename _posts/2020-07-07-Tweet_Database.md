# Tweets Database
An introduction to available capibilities and data on `hydra.uvm.edu`

```python
import pandas as pd
from pymongo import MongoClient
import numpy as np
import datetime
```

<a id='section1'></a>

## Connecting to the Database
Connections to the database are established using the `MongoClient`. Before trying to connect remember to forward the correct port to your machine, since you won't be able to access the server directly from off campus. 

The command I use to port forward is `ssh -N -f -L localhost:27016:localhost:27016 home-ti-89`, but you'd have to replace `home-ti-89` with your alias for `hydra.uvm.edu`.


```python
username = 'guest'
pwd = 'roboctopus'
client = MongoClient('mongodb://%s:%s@localhost:27016' % (username, pwd))
print(client)
```

    MongoClient(host=['localhost:27016'], document_class=dict, tz_aware=False, connect=True)

# Exploring Available Data
MongoDB organizes data into a heirachry. 
The top-most level is the database, which can contain a number of collections containing documents.
Below is an example database, `tweets` on hydra, which has a number of collections such as `geotweets`, or `one_percent`. Documents in our case are tweet objects.

The image is a screenshot of Mongo Compass [(Download here)](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass), a GUI application to explore data stored in a Mongo database visually. 

![](https://mvarnold.w3.uvm.edu/img/tweets.png)

To programatically see the available databases we can execute the following command:


```python
print(client.list_database_names())
```

    ['admin', 'config', 'fulltext', 'languages', 'local', 'tweets', 'tweets_ambient', 'tweets_segmented', 'tweets_segmented_ten_percent', 'tweets_segmented_test']


The important databases for Twitter researchers will be:
 * `tweets`: General tweet collections, like the `one_percent` sample (1% of the decahose) or `geo_tweets`.
 * `tweets_ambient`: Collections of tweets containing a specific word or n-gram of interest.
 * `tweets_segmented`: A continuation of the `one_percent` sample after 2020, which gets updated daily.
 * `tweets_segmented_ten_percent`: A ten percent sample of the decahose.

To select a database from the client object, we can use an attribute access style, such as `client.tweets`, or dictionary access style, such as `client['tweets']`. Let's see what collections are inside the tweets database on `hydra.uvm.edu`.


```python
database = client['tweets']
database.list_collection_names()
```




    ['trump_tweets_w_rt',
     'obama_tweets_from_handle',
     'trump_tweets_from_handle',
     'geotweets',
     'charlottesville',
     'tweets_from_handle',
     'obama_tweets_from_handle_beta',
     'one_percent',
     'trump_tweet_w_rt',
     'obama_tweets_w_rt',
     'trump_tweets_from_handle_beta',
     'tweets_w_rt']



We can also select collections from this database object using either syntax. 


```python
database['one_percent']
```




    Collection(Database(MongoClient(host=['localhost:27016'], document_class=dict, tz_aware=False, connect=True), 'tweets'), 'one_percent')



In general usage the function `tweet_connect` is all you need to return a collection object and start querying tweets.


```python
def tweet_connect(username, pwd, database='tweets', collection='one_percent'):
    client = MongoClient('mongodb://%s:%s@localhost:27016' % (username, pwd))
    db = client[database]
    tweets = db[collection]
    return tweets
```

<a id='section3'></a>

## Querying
Once a collection of tweets is selected, we can query for documents. For example the `find_one` method will return a document.


```python
collection = tweet_connect('guest','roboctopus')
collection.find_one()
```




    {'_id': ObjectId('5dfac73910db86313a1a4312'),
     'user': {'screen_name': 'ebarrera', 'id': 961201},
     'id': 9264581,
     'text': "I'm having lunch... 'Pain Vigneron', 'Mouse de Fois Gras', Comte Cheese, and Some Ethiopan Dish...",
     'created_at': 'Sun Mar 18 12:18:33 +0000 2007',
     'fastText_lang': 'en',
     'fastText_conf': 0.73,
     'tweet_created_at': datetime.datetime(2007, 3, 18, 12, 18, 33),
     'pure_text': "I'm having lunch... 'Pain Vigneron', 'Mouse de Fois Gras', Comte Cheese, and Some Ethiopan Dish..."}



Normally we want to query some specific subset of the data, so we write queries as dictionaries and pass them to a `find` method to return many documents. Let's find English tweets from Halloween in 2019. 

For an exact match on field, we just pass the dictionary key a value; therefore we'll let `fastText_lang`, the language feild, be `'en'`, e.i. `{'fastText_lang': 'en'}`.

If we want to specify a range, such as to match all tweets from 12:00am on Halloween to the next night, we can pass [mongo operators](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/) in dictionaries as the value to a key. The `tweet_created_at` field is what we want to match, so we send the value for it as `{'$gte':date, '$lt':date+datetime.timedelta(1)}`. Pymongo will except normal python datetime types in queries. Thus our full query is as follows:


```python
date = datetime.datetime(2019,10,31)
query = {'fastText_lang': 'en',
         'tweet_created_at': 
             {'$gte':date, '$lt':date+datetime.timedelta(1)}}
```

Let's look at the `pure_text` field of the matching tweets. We'll run our query, and iterate over the returned pymongo curser. You might want to quit if it runs for too long.


```python
for tweet in collection.find(query):
    try:
        print(tweet['pure_text'])
    except KeyError:
        pass
```

    The sleight of hand trick to replace "sex" with "gender" opened the door to the whole nonbinary universe of insanity.

    ‚ÄúOh my gosh it‚Äôs going to rain.. The kids can‚Äôt go out... Should we move Halloween to Saturday?‚Äù ...Discussions all day on October 30.
    
    What have we become?
    @MrTomPaye We just had our first bunch of little trick-or-treaters. Was glad to have a bag of Flake minis for them, but they were more interested in my "6 million cats" (who have the naughty habit of trying to run out when we answer the door). üòÇ
    Today we are open our normal hours. The only change is that Open Jump will start at 1pm directly after Rockin' Tots.
    
    We are offering a free meal to all first responders as well.

    As we are getting ready for trick-or-treating, our friends in the UK are getting ready to celebrate Bonfire Night! Every Nov. 5, they celebrate the safety of the king/queen with bonfires and fireworks displays all over the country!  #Europefacts

    Happy Halloween! What's your favorite candy to find in your treat bag?

    Looks like a stormy evening for us, which means fewer trick-or-treaters. BUT it also means any kids who show up tonight are getting massive handfuls of candy.

    it was such a roller coaster week, stressful and exhausting. As a treat to myself (not a trick) I'm welcoming long holidays with something I've waited for a long time (and before leaving PH) it's best to celebrate Sugarfree music tonight see you @ebedancel! üòä https://t.co/eVBVbWQROI
    Almost 730 pm on Halloween, not even one trick or treater. It ends at 8pm here. This makes two years. I go all out and decorate, buy hundreds of pieces of candy. All for what? Mad and very sad.. I know I live in a small town, but not even one kid?
    RT @NWSStateCollege:#RT @NWSStateCollege: The greatest risk for severe thunderstorms will be Thursday afternoon and evening as a cold front moves from west to east across PA.

    I was about 9 or 10 when my mom (who was white) let us trick or treat by ourselves for the first time.  It was also the first time i saw houses turn off the lights when we approached.  They hadn't turned off the light the year before. https://t.co/EOh8iEIKAj
    We hope it is a spooktacular night tomorrow! Head to #DowntownVernon with your kids for a night of asking local shops THE question!... Trick or treat! Start at Justice Park to get a bag &amp; a map of the #TreatTrail at 3 pm! PC: @DowntownVernon https://t.co/IzmxNYrna4 https://t.co/1lxMeIYnRk
    I bought too much candy for my students, thinking like my old schools teachers they would just send their kids to me randomly for Halloween. üòÇ
    I gave every kid who came in several pieces when they said trick or treat, gave some to coworkers to and I've barely made a dent. üç´üç≠üç¨
    As it‚Äôs HalloweenüéÉ, the next trick we wanted to treat you to is the art &amp; benefits of a positive mental attitude when faced with your ‚Äòto do‚Äô list. 
    
    So here‚Äôs @RussellTreasure with a couple of handy hints for you. Hope it helps pumpkin üéÉ

    Mitchell just told me they weren‚Äôt allowed to trick or treat growing up!! üò≠üò≠üò≠ What a sad childhood! I remember eating dinner as fast I can so we could hurry up and get as much candy as possible! I loved going door to door and meeting neighbors and just getting so much CANDY!!
    I remember me and a bunch of other kids on the street went trick or treating in the middle of summer once and everyone was like wtf but there was an Indian family in the neighborhood who was like "oh this must be some custom we don't know about" and gave us some shit
    Happy Halloween! üíÄ üëΩ üëªü¶áüéÉ
    
    I hope everyone will be enjoying this spooky time of the year by either trick or treating with your kids, watching a movie, reading a good book, or just hanging out with your family. I know I am going to be reading and spending the day with my dogs. https://t.co/J78nhhG5MW
    Thanks to those all sent me a reply today, I will get round to you. Just been a manic day. I also did my first trick or treating since I was a kid. Well my son wanted to do it and didn't want to let him down.
    
    Had to be back by the time #TOTP started though. Joke! ü§£

    It's literally a GRAPH OF TREE RING MXDs‚Äîright up until the late 20C. Yet by the mere trick of writing "temperature anomaly" on the left hand side, they've convinced you it's "about" temperatures. 
    
    You're the prime mark[et] for these frauds.

## Available Databases

### 1. `tweets`

Most simple tweet collections are stored in the `tweets` database.

##### Collections:

 - `one_percent` - A one percent sample of the decahose containing tweets from 2009 to the end of 2019. 
     Sample is continued after 2020/01/01 in the `tweets_segmented` collection so we can keep everything up to date.
 - `geotweets` - A collection of tweets with lat/long coordinates.
 - `charlottesville` - A full decahose sample for the time periods around the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, NC.
 
### 2. `tweets_segmented`

A continuation of the one percent sample, seperated into month-long collections. Begins in January, 2020.

### 3. `tweets_segmented_ten_percent`

A ten percent random sample of tweets, in the same month collection format as above.

### 4. `tweets_segmented_location`

A database of all tweets containing user location metadata that matches a US city. Divided into collections of one year. 

The user information is not time accurate as in the `geotweets` collection, but rather is the location given by the user when they created an account. 

### 5. `tweets_ambient`

A database of tweets containing a particular $n$-gram. Currently one collection exists: `mental_health`.
